## Overview

Welcome to What's Cookin'! With this website, you can search through our recipe database using featured tags, a search box, and manually using our infinite scroll feature. Tired of losing recipes? Use our "like" button to save your favorite recipes. 

## Features

This website has multiple features, including searching recipes through tags, searching from a user input search bar, saving recipes, and receiving a random recipe. The home page includes infinite scrolling. 

## Context

This website was created in our 7th and 8th week of Turing School of Software and Design. It took approx 20 hours of hands-on time, divided by the three of us.  

## Wins  

1. Learning to work asynchronously, while still creating cohesive code.
2. Using APIs and incorporating them into the website
3. Updating the Data Model before the DOM

## Challenges

1. Continuing to learn how to work on a time with different work-time preferences
2. Continuing to improve git workflow
3. Incorporating writing tests into a website
