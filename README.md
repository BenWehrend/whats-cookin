A frontend recipe and recipe tracking website. It calls a [backend server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api) for the data using the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)!

## üåü Overview

Welcome to What's Cookin'! With this website, you can search through our recipe database using featured tags, a search box, and manually using our infinite scroll feature. Tired of losing recipes? Use our "like" button to save your favorite recipes. This project was created to practice API calls, following TDD, and working on creating a complex web application in a team environment. We used Javascript, HTML, CSS for the core technologies with Mocha & Chai for our test suite.

## üîó Live Demo

[üëâLive Deploymentüëà](https://kojinkuro.github.io/whats-cookin/)

Note: You will need our backend server running for the above deployment to work. See [installation](#‚öôÔ∏è-installation--setup)

## üìö Context

This website was created in our 7th and 8th week of Turing School of Software and Design. This was a group project of three team members. This project took around 75 hours total, averaging 25 hours split amongst each member. This was built according to the following [spec sheet](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/whats-cookin-part-one.html). There was no design comp provided for this project so our team designed [our own](https://www.figma.com/file/sASmZkfzWbXObPqYVOh9vQ/Figma-basics?type=design&node-id=1669%3A162202&mode=design&t=KfxDWyuUGfOfMnEr-1).

## üèÜ Wins

1. Learning to work asynchronously, while still creating cohesive code.
2. Using APIs and incorporating them into the website
3. Updating the Data Model before the DOM

## üöß Challenges

1. Continuing to learn how to work on a time with different work-time preferences
2. Continuing to improve git workflow
3. Incorporating writing tests into a website

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### How do I get the application running? This is confusing!

We have a deployment on github pages [here](https://kojinkuro.github.io/whats-cookin/)! Running this application requires some level of you being comfortable using the terminal, and having git and npm installed on your local machine.

### The website is not loading and I got an error saying it was unable fetch data

Make sure you are running our backend server, [provided here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api). None of the data is stored in the program and is on a backend server that needs to be running.

### I'm getting an 422 error when I try to refavorite a previously favorited recipe

This application currently makes POST requests every time that

### When I refresh a page, I cannot refresh any page besides the main page without getting a 404 error

This application is only a frontend to grab data
