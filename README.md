## Context

This website was created in our 7th and 8th week of Turing School of Software and Design. This was a group project of three team memebers. This project took around 75 hours total, averaging 25 hours split amongst each memeber.

## Wins  

1. Learning to work asynchronously, while still creating cohesive code.
2. Using APIs and incorporating them into the website
3. Updating the Data Model before the DOM

## Challenges

1. Continuing to learn how to work on a time with different work-time preferences
2. Continuing to improve git workflow
3. Incorporating writing tests into a website
